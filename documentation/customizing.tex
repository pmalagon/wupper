\section{Customizing the application}
\subsection{connection of the DMA FIFOs}
The Virtex-7 PCIe Engine comes with a very simple user application, described in application.vhd.

This file contains a read and a write port for a FIFO. This FIFO has a port width of 256 bit and is read or written at 250 MHz, resulting in a theoretical throughput of 60Gbit/s.

In this example the FIFO that holds data from the PC direction PCIe, has been omitted and the port is left unconnected.

The FIFO that holds data which will be sent towards the PC, is connected to a simple process, this process has a 32 bit counter and a constant value, the 256 bit data which is sent into the PC memory has the following format:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL, frame=single, caption=Data format of example application]
s_fifo_din <= x"DEADBEEF"&cnt&x"00001111"&cnt&x"22223333"&cnt&x"44445555"&cnt;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Application specific registers}
Besides DMA memory reads and writes, the PCIe Engine also provides means to create a custom application specific register map. By default, the BAR2 register space is reserved for this purpose.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL, frame=single, caption=custom register types]
  type register_map_control_type is record
    BOARD_ID         : std_logic_vector(63 downto 0);    
    STATUS_LEDS      : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
  end record;
  
  type register_map_monitor_type is record
    READ_ONLY             : std_logic_vector(0 downto 0);    
    PLL_LOCK              : std_logic_vector(0 downto 0);    
  end record;
\end{lstlisting}

When adding registers to this map, there are two files (besides the application implementation) that need to be modified:
\begin{itemize}
 \item{pcie\_package.vhd} containing the address, the default value and the record type specification
 \item{dma\_control.vhd} containing the constant initialization, the read state machine and the write state machine
\end{itemize}

sections that should be modified can be recognized by searching for comments like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL, frame=single, caption=customizable sections]
  ------------------------------------------------
  ---- Application specific registers BEGIN   ----
  ------------------------------------------------
  ...
  ------------------------------------------------
  ---- Application specific registers END     ----
  ------------------------------------------------
\end{lstlisting}
